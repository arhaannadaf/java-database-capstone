This Spring Boot application follows a layered MVC-based architecture that combines server-side rendered views with RESTful services. The Admin and Doctor dashboards are implemented using Spring MVC controllers with Thymeleaf templates, allowing dynamic HTML rendering on the server. All other modules expose functionality through REST controllers, returning JSON responses for client-side consumption. This hybrid approach cleanly separates view-driven workflows from API-driven interactions while keeping the application cohesive.
At the core of the system is a shared service layer that enforces business logic and validation. All controllers—MVC and REST—delegate request handling to this service layer, which then communicates with the data access layer. The application uses MySQL with JPA entities and repositories to manage structured relational data such as patients, doctors, appointments, and admins. In parallel, MongoDB document models and repositories are used for prescription data, which benefits from a flexible schema. This design ensures strong separation of concerns, supports multiple data stores cleanly, and keeps the application scalable and maintainable.

1. A user (Admin, Doctor, or other client) initiates an action by accessing a dashboard page (via Thymeleaf) or by calling an API endpoint (via REST).
2. The request is received by the appropriate controller—either an MVC controller for Admin/Doctor dashboards or a REST controller for API-based modules.
3. The controller does not handle business logic directly; instead, it forwards the request and input data to the common service layer.
4. The service layer applies business rules, validations, and decision-making, determining which data operations are required.
5. Based on the type of data involved, the service layer delegates persistence operations to the correct repository—JPA repositories for MySQL or MongoDB repositories for prescriptions.
6. The database (MySQL or MongoDB) processes the request and returns the result back to the repository, which passes it up to the service layer.
7. The service layer returns the processed result to the controller, which then either renders a Thymeleaf view (for dashboards) or sends a JSON response back to the client (for REST APIs).
